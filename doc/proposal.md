Food Stuff Project

The Food Stuff Project is a web app that lets users manage two personal databases for their cooking needs.  “My Foods” will contain all of the food stuffs they currently have and “My Recipes” will hold a collection recipes a user can choose from.  
The two most basic functions are "Can I make it?" and “What can I make?.”  
“Can I Make” will have the user choose a recipe and will let them know if they have the ingredients they need to prepare desired food.  If user does not meet food requirements Food Stuff Project will generate a shopping list of sorts, somehow.
“What can I make” function looks at user's entire food collection and generates a list of recipes they have the ingredients to prepare.  Hopefully we will have some sorting features in there as well.

We would like the most basic product to include individual user authentication with personal food lists (foods are initially hard coded by devs or added by user). We will most likely use and hardcode recipes into database as well.  And first run will use generic units of measurements.
Shopping list creation, food/recipe sorting, actual food measurements and conversion methods  
 and automation options for the food entry and recipe retrievals are being looked into. 
At this point we know little of what it takes to make a db driven web app.
