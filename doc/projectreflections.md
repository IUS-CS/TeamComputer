# Project Reflections

### My experience with the project
After working through this project, I realized that doing research thoroughly is important. We used Asp.net for our project. It is a framework we had no experience with. There were many times we ran into problems we did not understand. If we would have researched more it would have been an easier process to overcome those problems.

### Tasks I have done
* Unit testing, I setup some of the test for the controllers. I had to create mock objects for those tests which is something I have never had to do before. The controller classes I was testing needed the repository interfaces we created, so I had to create a mock repository for the tests. The mock repository allowed me to test without the test affecting our database.
* Creating the food controller, I was tasked with creating the controller to handle displaying and editing the user's food items. I had to learn about how Asp.net uses the MVC design pattern. The controller works by getting the users food items from the database and storing it into a list. The list is then passed to the view. When you pass an object to a view, that view's model is based off the passed object. Then the view iterates through the list and shows the food.
* Planning the project, when planning on how to design and create the database I thought we agreed on the same thing. We continued to work through the project, getting our models to hold the data from the database. Then we found out how we were making our models work conflicted. I learned that the planning process should have been more in depth, so we would know that we were agreeing on the same thing.
