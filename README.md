TeamComputer is building a web app that allows users to input the 
ingredients they have available to make meals with, then compare to 
recipes stored in the user profile.  Once it has compared ingredients 
with the list of recipes it will show you what meals you have the 
ability to make based off the ingredients you have available.

## To Do
One of the features we plan to implement is the ability to plan out 
meals in advance and get a list ingredients needed and generate a 
grocery list.
